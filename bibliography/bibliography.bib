  abstract	= {The worldwide decline of coral reefs calls for an urgent
		  reassessment of current management practices. Confronting
		  large-scale crises requires a major scaling-up of
		  management efforts based on an improved understanding of
		  the ecological processes that underlie reef resilience.
		  Managing for improved resilience, incorporating the role of
		  human activity in shaping ecosystems, provides a basis for
		  coping with uncertainty, future changes and ecological
		  surprises. Here we review the ecological roles of critical
		  functional groups (for both corals and reef fishes) that
		  are fundamental to understanding resilience and avoiding
		  phase shifts from coral dominance to less desirable,
		  degraded ecosystems. We identify striking biogeographic
		  differences in the species richness and composition of
		  functional groups, which highlight the vulnerability of
		  Caribbean reef ecosystems. These findings have profound
		  implications for restoration of degraded reefs, management
		  of fisheries, and the focus on marine protected areas and
		  biodiversity hotspots as priorities for conservation.},

@Article{	  biggs2009,
  abstract	= {Ecological regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting
		  changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts
		  on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional
		  regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but
		  prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously
		  difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in
		  ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and
		  autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning
		  indicators of impending shifts. A critical question,
		  however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient
		  warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We
		  examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime
		  shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or
		  shoreline development (only gradual restoration is
		  possible). The model represents key features of a broad
		  class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers
		  can only be manipulated gradually management action is
		  needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if
		  drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be
		  delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the
		  indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated,
		  often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve
		  usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that
		  research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather
		  than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical
		  indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem
		  attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio
		  indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is
		  also dependent on developing policy processes that enable
		  society to respond more rapidly to information about
		  impending regime shifts.},

  abstract	= {Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to
		  study adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular
		  methods model selection directly.We explain and develop a
		  method based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first
		  proposed by Hansen. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate
		  both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively
		  different from, and more general than, pure drift models
		  based on Brownian motion. Most importantly,OU models
		  possess selective optima that formalize the notion of
		  adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for
		  one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its
		  parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our
		  approach allows us to translate hy- potheses regarding
		  adaptation in different selective regimes into ex- plicit
		  models, to test the models against data using maximum-like-
		  lihood-based model selection techniques, and to infer
		  details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the
		  method using two worked examples. Relative to existing
		  approaches, the direct modeling ap- proach we demonstrate
		  allows one to explore more detailed hy- potheses and to
		  utilize more of the information content of com- parative
		  data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a
		  model selection framework to simultaneously compare a
		  variety of hy- potheses advances our ability to assess

  abstract	= {Because novel ecological conditions can cause severe and
		  long-lasting environmental damage with large economic
		  costs, ecologists must identify possible environmental
		  regime shifts and pro-actively guide ecosystem management.
		  As an illustrative example, we applied six potential
		  indicators of impending regime shifts to S. R. Carpenter
		  and W. A. Brock's model of lake eutrophication and analyzed
		  whether or not they afforded adequate advance warning to
		  enable preventative interventions. Our initial analyses
		  suggest that an indicator based on the high-frequency
		  signal in the spectral density of the time-series provides
		  the best advance warning of a regime shift, even when only
		  incomplete information about underlying system drivers and
		  processes is available. In light of this result, we
		  explored two key factors associated with using indicators
		  to prevent regime shifts. The first key factor is the
		  amount of inertia in the system; i.e., how fast the system
		  will react to a change in management, given that a manager
		  can actually control relevant system drivers. If rapid,
		  intensive management is possible, our analyses suggest that
		  an indicator must provide at least 20 years advance warning
		  to reduce the probability of a regime shift to < 5\%. As
		  time to intervention is increased or intensity of
		  intervention is decreased, the necessary amount of advance
		  warning required to avoid a regime shift increases
		  exponentially. The second key factor concerns the amount
		  and type of variability intrinsic to the system, and the
		  impact of this variability on the power of an indicator.
		  Indicators are considered powerful if they detect an
		  impending regime shift with adequate lead time for
		  effective management intervention, but not so far in
		  advance that interventions are too costly or unnecessary.
		  Intrinsic "noise" in the system obscures the "signal"
		  provided by all indicators, and therefore, the power of the
		  indicators declines rapidly with increasing within- and
		  between-year variability in measurable variables or
		  parameters. Our results highlight the key role of human
		  decisions in managing ecosystems and the importance of
		  pro-active application of the precautionary principle to
		  avoid regime shifts.},

@Article{	  freckleton2002,
  abstract	= {The question is often raised whether it is statistically
		  necessary to control for phylogenetic associations in
		  comparative studies. To investigate this question, we
		  explore the use of a measure of phylogenetic correlation,
		  lambda, introduced by Pagel (1999), that normally varies
		  between 0 (phylogenetic independence) and 1 (species'
		  traits covary in direct proportion to their shared
		  evolutionary history). Simulations show lambda to be a
		  statistically powerful index for measuring whether data
		  exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and whether it has
		  low rates of Type I error. Moreover, lambda is robust to
		  incomplete phylogenetic information, which demonstrates
		  that even partial information on phylogeny will improve the
		  accuracy of phylogenetic analyses. To assess whether traits
		  generally show phylogenetic associations, we present a
		  quantitative review of 26 published phylogenetic
		  comparative data sets. The data sets include 103 traits and
		  were chosen from the ecological literature in which debate
		  about the need for phylogenetic correction has been most
		  acute. Eighty-eight percent of data sets contained at least
		  one character that displayed significant phylogenetic
		  dependence, and 60\% of characters overall (pooled across
		  studies) showed significant evidence of phylogenetic
		  association. In 16\% of tests, phylogenetic correlation
		  could be neither supported nor rejected. However, most of
		  these equivocal results were found in small phylogenies and
		  probably reflect a lack of power. We suggest that the
		  parameter lambda be routinely estimated when analyzing
		  comparative data, since it can also be used simultaneously
		  to adjust the phylogenetic correction in a manner that is
		  optimal for the data set, and we present an example of how
		  this may be done.},
  annote	= {Notes on Pagel's Lambda:
		  
		  lambda = 1 means two traits perfectly correlated under
		  brownian motion.
		  
		  is a multiplier of the correlation (off-diagonals)
		  introduced by tree to otherwise independent random walks.
		  hence 0 means that correlation is lost, whereas 1 means all
		  the correlation is introduced by the tree, >1 means more
		  corrleated than expected by tree alone -- i.e. the indep
		  contrasts should also be correlated!
		  
		  Not a measure of phylogenetic signal, which should be
		  defined for a single (scalar) trait. Also should be defined
		  independent of brownian motion

		  northern Lesser Antilles were studied with starch gel
		  electrophoresis. A total of 22 genetic loci was analyzed
		  for 15 populations. These data were used to estimate
		  genetic distance between populations, and genetic variation
		  within populations. Genetic distance estimates between
		  populations are considerably lower than the estimates for
		  the ecologically equivalent Anolis roquet species group of
		  the southern Lesser Antilles. The relative proximity of
		  islands in the northern part of the archipelago increases
		  the probability of multiple colonizations, hence
		  introgression, and a relatively slower rate of genetic
		  divergence. The data also suggest that the northern
		  bimaculatus group is evolutionarily younger than the roquet
		  group, hence has had less time for genetic divergence.
		  There is a geographic pattern discernible in the genetic
		  distance data. One very tight cluster involves the
		  southernmost populations studied from Dominica, Guadeloupe,
		  Marie Gallante, and Montserrat; a second cluster includes
		  more northern forms from Redonda, Saba, and St. Martin.
		  Variability is lowest on the three smallest islands, but
		  beyond that, there is no correlation between island size
		  and heterozygosity. Relative degree of heterozygosity may
		  be related to colonization history. Source populations tend
		  to have higher variability than derived populations. The
		  degree of genetic differentiation as estimated
		  electrophoretically is very poorly correlated with
		  differentiation for morphological characters such as body
		  size, color, or pattern.},

  abstract	= {George Gaylord Simpson famously postulated that much of
		  life's diversity originated as adaptive radiations-more or
		  less simultaneous divergences of numerous lines from a
		  single ancestral adaptive type. However, identifying
		  adaptive radiations has proven difficult due to a lack of
		  broad-scale comparative datasets. Here, we use phylogenetic
		  comparative data on body size and shape in a diversity of
		  animal clades to test a key model of adaptive radiation, in
		  which initially rapid morphological evolution is followed
		  by relative stasis. We compared the fit of this model to
		  both single selective peak and random walk models. We found
		  little support for the early-burst model of adaptive
		  radiation, whereas both other models, particularly that of
		  selective peaks, were commonly supported. In addition, we
		  found that the net rate of morphological evolution varied
		  inversely with clade age. The youngest clades appear to
		  evolve most rapidly because long-term change typically does
		  not attain the amount of divergence predicted from rates
		  measured over short time scales. Across our entire
		  analysis, the dominant pattern was one of constraints
		  shaping evolution continually through time rather than
		  rapid evolution followed by stasis. We suggest that the
		  classical model of adaptive radiation, where morphological
		  evolution is initially rapid and slows through time, may be
		  rare in comparative data.},

		  ecological models and, therefore, also likely to be a class
		  of natural systems for which there will be no forewarning

		  combination with environmental variability lead to model
		  descriptions that will not have smooth potentials,
		  concluding that many ecological systems are described by
		  systems without smooth potentials and thus will not show
		  typical leading indicators of regime shifts. We then

		  applications including mathematical biology, climate
		  change, human physiology and economics. A dynamical system
		  that was in a stable state suddenly changes to a distant
		  attractor. Therefore it is highly desirable to find
		  early-warning signs for these critical transitions.
		  Although several different approaches have been proposed
		  for specific models, a detailed mathematical theory has not
		  been developed yet. In this paper we provide another
		  building block of this theory beyond the first results
		  developed in [C. Kuehn. "A mathematical framework for
		  critical transitions: bifurcations, fast-slow systems and
		  stochastic dynamics", submitted, 2010]. We start from
		  classical bifurcation theory and normal forms to classify
		  critical transitions. Using this approach, we proceed to
		  stochastic fluctuations and provided detailed scaling laws
		  of the variance of stochastic sample paths near critical
		  transitions. To show that our theory naturally extends
		  bifurcation theory we apply it to several models: the
		  Stommel-Cessi box model for the thermohaline circulation
		  from geoscience, an epidemic-spreading model on an adaptive
		  network, an activator-inhibitor switch from systems
		  biology, a predator-prey system from ecology and to the

  abstract	= {We have used the Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system
		  modelling framework to study the archetypal example of a
		  tipping point in the climate system; a threshold for the
		  collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC).
		  eScience has been invaluable in this work and we explain
		  how we have made it work for us. Two stable states of the
		  THC have been found to coexist, under the same boundary
		  conditions, in a hierarchy of models. The climate forcing
		  required to collapse the THC and the reversibility or
		  irreversibility of such a collapse depends on uncertain
		  model parameters. Automated methods have been used to
		  assimilate observational data to constrain the pertinent
		  parameters. Anthropogenic climate forcing leads to a robust
		  weakening of the THC and increases the probability of
		  crossing a THC tipping point, but some ensemble members
		  collapse readily, whereas others are extremely resistant.
		  Hence, we test general methods that have been developed to
		  directly diagnose, from time-series data, the proximity of
		  a 'tipping element', such as the THC to a bifurcation
		  point. In a three-dimensional ocean-atmosphere model
		  exhibiting THC hysteresis, despite high variability in the
		  THC driven by the dynamical atmosphere, some early warning

		  investigating evolutionary questions. By contrast,
		  systematic biology is now one of the most vigorous

		  is requisite in macroevolutionary studies but also has been
		  applied to a wide range of topics and fields that no one
		  could possibly have envisioned 30 years ago. My message is
		  simple: phylogenies are fundamental to comparative biology,
		  but they are not the be-all and end-all. Phylogenies are
		  powerful tools for understanding the past, but like any
		  tool, they have their limitations. In addition, phylogenies
		  are much more informative about pattern than they are about
		  process. The best way to fully understand the past-both
		  pattern and process-is to integrate phylogenies with other
		  types of historical data as well as with direct studies of

  abstract	= {The deteriorating health of the world's coral reefs
		  threatens global biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the
		  livelihoods of millions of people living in tropical
		  coastal regions. Reefs in the Caribbean are among the most
		  heavily affected, having experienced mass disease-induced
		  mortality of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum in
		  1983 and two framework-building species of coral. Declining
		  reef health is characterized by increases in macroalgae. A
		  critical question is whether the observed macroalgal bloom
		  on Caribbean reefs is easily reversible. To answer this
		  question, we must resolve whether algal-dominated reefs are
		  an alternative stable state of the ecosystem or simply the
		  readily reversible result of a phase change along a
		  gradient of some environmental or ecological parameter.
		  Here, using a fully parameterized simulation model in
		  combination with a simple analytical model, we show that
		  Caribbean reefs became susceptible to alternative stable
		  states once the urchin mortality event of 1983 confined the
		  majority of grazing to parrotfishes. We reveal dramatic
		  hysteresis in a natural system and define critical
		  thresholds of grazing and coral cover beyond which
		  resilience is lost. Most grazing thresholds lie near the
		  upper level observed for parrotfishes in nature, suggesting
		  that reefs are highly sensitive to parrotfish exploitation.
		  Ecosystem thresholds can be combined with stochastic models
		  of disturbance to identify targets for the restoration of
		  ecosystem processes. We illustrate this principle by
		  estimating the relationship between current reef state
		  (coral cover and grazing) and the probability that the reef
		  will withstand moderate hurricane intensity for two decades
		  without becoming entrained in a shift towards a stable
		  macroalgal-dominated state. Such targets may help reef
		  managers face the challenge of addressing global
		  disturbance at local scales.},

		  livelihoods of millions of people living in tropical
		  coastal regions. Reefs in the Caribbean are among the most
		  heavily affected, having experienced mass disease-induced
		  mortality of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum in
		  1983 and two framework-building species of coral. Declining
		  reef health is characterized by increases in macroalgae. A
		  critical question is whether the observed macroalgal bloom
		  on Caribbean reefs is easily reversible. To answer this
		  question, we must resolve whether algal-dominated reefs are
		  an alternative stable state of the ecosystem or simply the
		  readily reversible result of a phase change along a
		  gradient of some environmental or ecological parameter.
		  Here, using a fully parameterized simulation model in
		  combination with a simple analytical model, we show that
		  Caribbean reefs became susceptible to alternative stable
		  states once the urchin mortality event of 1983 confined the
		  majority of grazing to parrotfishes. We reveal dramatic
		  hysteresis in a natural system and define critical
		  thresholds of grazing and coral cover beyond which
		  resilience is lost. Most grazing thresholds lie near the
		  upper level observed for parrotfishes in nature, suggesting
		  that reefs are highly sensitive to parrotfish exploitation.
		  Ecosystem thresholds can be combined with stochastic models
		  of disturbance to identify targets for the restoration of
		  ecosystem processes. We illustrate this principle by
		  estimating the relationship between current reef state
		  (coral cover and grazing) and the probability that the reef
		  will withstand moderate hurricane intensity for two decades
		  without becoming entrained in a shift towards a stable
		  macroalgal-dominated state. Such targets may help reef
		  managers face the challenge of addressing global
		  disturbance at local scales.},

  abstract	= {Aim: Provide a new multivariate hypothesis testing
		  approach for the evolution of continuous characters in a
		  phylogenetic context. Background: Brownian motion is the
		  most commonly used model for the evolution of quantitative
		  traits. Under multivariate Brownian motion, the evolution
		  of multiple continuous traits can be described by an
		  evolutionary rate matrix in which the diagonal elements
		  determine the rate of evolution for individual characters,
		  while the off-diagonal elements determine the extent to
		  which different characters co-evolve. Method: We present
		  likelihood tests for two simple hypotheses about the
		  evolutionary rate matrix: (1) equality or proportionality
		  to a hypothetical matrix; and (2) concerted change in the
		  rate matrix in a certain portion or portions of the
		  phylogenetic tree. In case (1), the hypothetical matrix
		  might be estimated from the within-species additive genetic
		  variance-covariance matrix. In case (2), concerted change
		  in the evolutionary rate matrix might result from shifts in
		  ploidy level or the mutation rate. We illustrate these
		  hypothesis tests using data from individual-based
		  quantitative genetic simulations on stochastic phylogenetic
		  trees. Results: Our evolutionary rate matrix estimator
		  exhibited minimal bias. Type I errors in our
		  likelihood-based tests for matrix equality and
		  proportionality were very close to appropriate levels.
		  Power to detect selection was also sufficient, except in
		  the case of the weakest selection simulated in this study.
		  Type I error and the accuracy of parameter estimation in
		  the test for rate matrix heterogeneity were also
		  adequate.},

		  consumers with complex life cycles (CLC), in which
		  different life stages inhabit different ecosystems. Using a
		  structured consumer resource model that accounts for the
		  independent effects of two resources on consumer growth and
		  reproductive rates, we show that such indirect connections
		  between ecosystems can result in alternative stable states
		  characterized by adult-dominated and juvenile-dominated
		  consumer populations. As a consequence, gradual changes in
		  ecosystem productivity or mortality rates of the consumer
		  can lead to dramatic and abrupt regime shifts across
		  different ecosystems, hysteresis and counterintuitive
		  changes in the consumer abundances. Whether these counter
		  intuitive or abrupt responses occur depend on the relative
		  productivity of both habitats and which consumer life-stage

  abstract	= {Abstract Regime shifts are massive, often irreversible,
		  rearrangements of nonlinear ecological processes that occur
		  when systems pass critical transition points. Ecological
		  regime shifts sometimes have severe consequences for human
		  well-being, including eutrophication in lakes,
		  desertification, and species extinctions. Theoretical and
		  laboratory evidence suggests that statistical anomalies may
		  be detectable leading indicators of regime shifts in
		  ecological time series, making it possible to foresee and
		  potentially avert incipient regime shifts. Conditional
		  heteroscedasticity is persistent variance characteristic of
		  time series with clustered volatility. Here, we analyze
		  conditional heteroscedasticity as a potential leading
		  indicator of regime shifts in ecological time series. We
		  evaluate conditional heteroscedasticity by using ecological
		  models with and without four types of critical transition.
		  On approaching transition points, all time series contain
		  significant conditional heteroscedasticity. This signal is
		  detected hundreds of time steps in advance of the regime
		  shift. Time series without regime shifts do not have
		  significant conditional heteroscedasticity. Because
		  probability values are easily associated with tests for
		  conditional heteroscedasticity, detection of false
		  positives in time series without regime shifts is
		  minimized. This property reduces the need for a reference
		  system to compare with the perturbed system.},

		  resilience may easily be tipped into an alternative basin
		  of attraction by a stochastic event. Unfortunately, it is
		  very difficult to measure ecological resilience in

		  is a remarkably good indicator of ecological resilience.
		  Such recovery rates decrease as a catastrophic regime shift
		  is approached, a phenomenon known in physics as "critical
		  slowing down." We demonstrate the robust occurrence of
		  critical slowing down in six ecological models and outline
		  a possible experimental approach to quantify differences in
		  recovery rates. In all the models we analyzed, critical
		  slowing down becomes apparent quite far from a threshold
		  point, suggesting that it may indeed be of practical use as
		  an early warning signal. Despite the fact that critical
		  slowing down could also indicate other critical
		  transitions, such as a stable system becoming oscillatory,
		  the robustness of the phenomenon makes it a promising
		  indicator of loss of resilience and the risk of upcoming
		  regime shifts in a system.},

However, the scales at which these laws apply are not necessarily relevant to data sharing practice among individuals (e.g., in virtual, social communities). Rather, the data sharing communities and their members often form their own policies, practices and norms governing data sharing. Using common property theory, our research objectives were to determine: (1) parallels between data sharing communities and natural resource-sharing communities; (2) factors that lead to successful data sharing; (3) circumstances under which rules, laws and policies govern data sharing. We used cases from two emerging data sharing communities in the environmental sciencesa micrometeorology community (FLUXNET) and a satellite remote sensing community. Cases of data sharing without conflict or irresolvable disputes had more principles in common with a successfully managed natural resource commons than did those characterized by conflict. Successful data sharing requires that biophysical scientists be more attentive to the social nature of data sharing.},

      fundamental and unexplained pattern of vertebrate
      biodiversity. Although species richness in groups like
      mammals, birds, or teleost fishes is often attributed to
      accelerated cladogenesis, we lack a quantitative conceptual
      framework for identifying and comparing the exceptional
      changes of tempo in vertebrate evolutionary history. We
      develop MEDUSA, a stepwise approach based upon the Akaike
      information criterion for detecting multiple shifts in
      birth and death rates on an incompletely resolved
      phylogeny. We apply MEDUSA incompletely to a diversity tree
      summarizing both evolutionary relationships and species
      richness of 44 major clades of jawed vertebrates. We
      identify 9 major changes in the tempo of gnathostome
      diversification; the most significant of these lies at the
      base of a clade that includes most of the coral-reef
      associated fishes as well as cichlids and perches. Rate
      increases also underlie several well recognized tetrapod
      radiations, including most modern birds, lizards and
      snakes, ostariophysan fishes, and most eutherian mammals.
      In addition, we find that large sections of the vertebrate
      tree exhibit nearly equal rates of origination and
      extinction, providing some of the first evidence from
      molecular data for the importance of faunal turnover in
      shaping biodiversity. Together, these results reveal living
      vertebrate biodiversity to be the product of volatile
      turnover punctuated by 6 accelerations responsible for
      >85\% of all species as well as 3 slowdowns that have
      produced "living fossils." In addition, by revealing the
      timing of the exceptional pulses of vertebrate
      diversification as well as the clades that experience them,
      our diversity tree provides a framework for evaluating

      manipulating text and data. They are now standard features
      in a wide range of languages and popular tools, including
      Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, VB.NET and C\# (and any language
      using the .NET Framework), PHP, and MySQL. If you don't use
      regular expressions yet, you will discover in this book a
      whole new world of mastery over your data. If you already
      use them, you'll appreciate this book's unprecedented
      detail and breadth of coverage. If you think you know all
      you need to know about regular expressions, this book is a
      stunning eye-opener. As this book shows, a command of
      regular expressions is an invaluable skill. Regular
      expressions allow you to code complex and subtle text
      processing that you never imagined could be automated.
      Regular expressions can save you time and aggravation. They
      can be used to craft elegant solutions to a wide range of
      problems. Once you've mastered regular expressions, they'll
      become an invaluable part of your toolkit. You will wonder
      how you ever got by without them. Yet despite their wide
      availability, flexibility, and unparalleled power, regular
      expressions are frequently underutilized. Yet what is power
      in the hands of an expert can be fraught with peril for the
      unwary. Mastering Regular Expressionswill help you navigate
      the minefield to becoming an expert and help you optimize
      your use of regular expressions. Mastering Regular
      Expressions, Third Edition, now includes a full chapter
      devoted to PHP and its powerful and expressive suite of
      regular expression functions, in addition to enhanced PHP
      coverage in the central "core" chapters. Furthermore, this
      edition has been updated throughout to reflect advances in
      other languages, including expanded in-depth coverage of
      Sun's java.util.regexpackage, which has emerged as the
      standard Java regex implementation.Topics include: A
      comparison of features among different versions of many
      languages and tools How the regular expression engine works
      Optimization (major savings available here!) Matching just

      chapters on individual languages Written in the lucid,
      entertaining tone that makes a complex, dry topic become
      crystal-clear to programmers, and sprinkled with solutions
      to complex real-world problems, Mastering Regular
      Expressions, Third Edition offers a wealth information that

  abstract  = {The family Labridae (including scarines and odacines)
      contains 82 genera and about 600 species of fishes that
      inhabit coastal and continental shelf waters in tropical
      and temperate oceans throughout the world. The Labridae
      (the wrasses) is the fifth largest fish family and second
      largest marine fish family, and is one of the most
      morphologically and ecologically diversified families of
      fishes in size, shape, and color. Labrid phylogeny is a
      long-standing problem in ichthyology that is part of the
      larger question of relationships within the suborder
      Labroidei. A phylogenetic analysis of labrids was conducted
      to investigate relationships among the six classical tribes
      of wrasses, the affinities of the wrasses to the
      parrotfishes (scarines), and the broad phylogenetic
      structure among labrid genera. Four gene fragments were
      sequenced from 98 fish species, including 84 labrid fishes
      and 14 outgroup taxa. Taxa were chosen from all major
      labrid clades and most major global ocean regions where
      labrid fishes exist, as well as cichlid, pomacentrid, and
      embiotocid outgroups. From the mitochondrial genome we
      sequenced portions of 12S rRNA (1000 bp) and 16S rRNA (585
      bp), which were aligned by using a secondary structure
      model. From the nuclear genome, we sequenced part of the
      protein-coding genes RAG2 (846 bp) and Tmo4C4 (541 bp).
      Maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and Bayesian
      analyses on the resulting 2972 bp of DNA sequence produced
      similar topologies that confirm the monophyly of a family
      Labridae that includes the parrotfishes and butterfishes
      and strong support for many previously identified taxonomic
      subgroups. The tribe Hypsigenyini (hogfishes, tuskfishes)
      is the sister group to the remaining labrids and includes
      odacines and the chisel-tooth wrasse Pseudodax moluccanus,
      a species previously considered close to scarines.
      Cheilines and scarines are sister-groups, closely related
      to the temperate Labrini, and pseudocheilines and cheilines
      are split in all phylogenies. The razorfishes (novaculines)
      and temperate pseudolabrines form successive sister clades
      to the large crown group radiation of the Julidini. The
      cleaner wrasses (Labrichthyini) are nested within this
      radiation and several julidine genera do not appear to be
      monophyletic (e.g., Coris and Halichoeres). Invasion of
      temperate water by this predominantly tropical group has
      occurred multiple times and the reconstruction of
      biogeography assuming an Indo-Pacific ancestor results in
      five different lineages invading the Atlantic/Caribbean
      region. Functional novelties in the feeding apparatus have
      allowed labrid fishes to occupy nearly every feeding guild
      in reef environments, and trophic variation is a central
      axis of diversification in this family.},

  abstract  = {Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to
      study adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular
      methods model selection directly.We explain and develop a
      method based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first
      proposed by Hansen. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate
      both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively
      different from, and more general than, pure drift models
      based on Brownian motion. Most importantly,OU models
      possess selective optima that formalize the notion of
      adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for
      one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its
      parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our
      approach allows us to translate hy- potheses regarding
      adaptation in different selective regimes into ex- plicit
      models, to test the models against data using maximum-like-
      lihood-based model selection techniques, and to infer
      details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the
      method using two worked examples. Relative to existing
      approaches, the direct modeling ap- proach we demonstrate
      allows one to explore more detailed hy- potheses and to
      utilize more of the information content of com- parative
      data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a
      model selection framework to simultaneously compare a
      variety of hy- potheses advances our ability to assess
      alternative evolutionary explanations.},

  abstract  = {Numerous evolutionary studies have sought to explain the
      distribution of diversity across the limbs of the tree of
      life. At the same time, ecological studies have sought to
      explain differences in diversity and relative abundance
      within and among ecological communities. Traditionally,
      these patterns have been considered separately, but models
      that consider processes operating at the level of
      individuals, such as neutral biodiversity theory (NBT), can
      provide a link between them. Here, we compare evolutionary
      dynamics across a suite of NBT models. We show that NBT can
      yield phylogenetic tree topologies with imbalance closely
      resembling empirical observations. In general,
      metacommunities that exhibit greater disparity in abundance
      are characterized by more imbalanced phylogenetic trees.
      However, NBT fails to capture the tempo of diversification
      as represented by the distribution of branching events
      through time. We suggest that population-level processes
      might therefore help explain the asymmetry of phylogenetic
      trees, but that tree shape might mislead estimates of
      evolutionary rates unless the diversification process is
      modeled explicitly.},

      to characterize the evolution of climatic niches in

      from that we make inferences on diversification in relation
      to climate. The evolution of climatic tolerances in Anogra
      + Kleinia has been heterogeneous, across phylogenetic
      groups and across different dimensions of climate. All the
      extant taxa occur in semiarid to arid conditions (annual
      precipitation of 10.1-49.1 cm and high temperatures in the
      warmest month of 28.5 degrees-40.1 degrees C), but there is
      striking variation among taxa in their climatic tolerances,
      especially temperature (minimum temperatures in the coldest
      month of -14.0 degrees to 5.3 degrees C) and summer versus
      winter precipitation (precipitation in the warmest quarter
      of 0.6-19.4 cm). Climatic disparity is especially
      pronounced in two subclades (californica, deltoides) that
      radiated in the southwestern United States and California,
      apparently including both divergent and convergent
      evolution of climatic tolerances. This niche evolution is
      remarkable, given the probable timescale of the radiation
      (approximately 1 million years). We suggest that the
      spatiotemporal climatic heterogeneity of western North
      America has served as a driver of diversification. Our data
      are also consistent with Axelrod's hypothesis that the
      spread of arid conditions in western North America
      stimulated diversification of arid-adapted lineages.},

  abstract  = {Species traits may influence rates of speciation and
      extinction, affecting both the patterns of diversification
      among lineages and the distribution of traits among
      species. Existing likelihood approaches for detecting
      differential diversification require complete phylogenies;
      that is, every extant species must be present in a
      well-resolved phylogeny. We developed 2 likelihood methods
      that can be used to infer the effect of a trait on
      speciation and extinction without complete phylogenetic
      information, generalizing the recent binary-state
      speciation and extinction method. Our approaches can be
      used where a phylogeny can be reasonably assumed to be a
      random sample of extant species or where all extant species
      are included but some are assigned only to terminal
      unresolved clades. We explored the effects of decreasing
      phylogenetic resolution on the ability of our approach to
      detect differential diversification within a Bayesian
      framework using simulated phylogenies. Differential
      diversification caused by an asymmetry in speciation rates
      was nearly as well detected with only 50\% of extant
      species phylogenetically resolved as with complete
      phylogenetic knowledge. We demonstrate our unresolved clade
      method with an analysis of sexual dimorphism and
      diversification in shorebirds (Charadriiformes). Our
      methods allow for the direct estimation of the effect of a
      trait on speciation and extinction rates using incompletely

  abstract  = {Quantitative traits have long been hypothesized to affect
      speciation and extinction rates. For example, smaller body
      size or increased specialization may be associated with
      increased rates of diversification. Here, I present a
      phylogenetic likelihood-based method (quantitative state
      speciation and extinction [QuaSSE]) that can be used to
      test such hypotheses using extant character distributions.
      This approach assumes that diversification follows a
      birth-death process where speciation and extinction rates
      may vary with one or more traits that evolve under a
      diffusion model. Speciation and extinction rates may be
      arbitrary functions of the character state, allowing much
      flexibility in testing models of trait-dependent
      diversification. I test the approach using simulated
      phylogenies and show that a known relationship between
      speciation and a quantitative character could be recovered
      in up to 80\% of the cases on large trees (500 species).
      Consistent with other approaches, detecting shifts in
      diversification due to differences in extinction rates was
      harder than when due to differences in speciation rates.
      Finally, I demonstrate the application of QuaSSE to
      investigate the correlation between body size and
      diversification in primates, concluding that clade-specific
      differences in diversification may be more important than
      size-dependent diversification in shaping the patterns of
      diversity within this group.},

  abstract  = {Animal taxa show remarkable variability in species
      richness across phylogenetic groups. Most explanations for
      this disparity postulate that taxa with more species have
      phenotypes or ecologies that cause higher diversification
      rates (i.e., higher speciation rates or lower extinction
      rates). Here we show that clade longevity, and not
      diversification rate, has primarily shaped patterns of
      species richness across major animal clades: more diverse
      taxa are older and thus have had more time to accumulate
      species. Diversification rates calculated from 163
      species-level molecular phylogenies were highly consistent
      within and among three major animal phyla (Arthropoda,
      Chordata, Mollusca) and did not correlate with species
      richness. Clades with higher estimated diversification
      rates were younger, but species numbers increased with
      increasing clade age. A fossil-based data set also revealed
      a strong, positive relationship between total extant
      species richness and crown group age across the orders of
      insects and vertebrates. These findings do not negate the
      importance of ecology or phenotype in influencing
      diversification rates, but they do show that clade
      longevity is the dominant signal in major animal
      biodiversity patterns. Thus, some key innovations may have
      acted through fostering clade longevity and not by
      heightening diversification rate.},

  abstract  = {Clades diversify in an ecological context, but most
      macroevolutionary models do not directly encapsulate
      ecological mechanisms that influence speciation and
      extinction. A data set of 245 chordate, arthropod, mollusk,
      and magnoliophyte phylogenies had a majority of clades that
      showed rapid lineage accumulation early with a slowing more
      recently, whereas a small but significant minority showed
      accelerated lineage accumulation in their recent histories.
      Previous analyses have demonstrated that macroevolutionary
      birth-death models can replicate the pattern of slowing
      lineage accumulation only by a strong decrease in
      speciation rate with increasing species richness and
      extinction rate held extremely low or absent. In contrast,
      the metacommunity model presented here could generate the
      full range of patterns seen in the real phylogenies by
      simply manipulating the degree of ecological
      differentiation of new species at the time of speciation.
      Specifically, the metacommunity model predicts that clades
      showing decelerating lineage accumulation rates are those
      that have diversified by ecological modes of speciation,
      whereas clades showing accelerating lineage accumulation
      rates are those that have diversified primarily by modes of
      speciation that generate little or no ecological
      diversification. A number of testable predictions that
      integrate data from molecular systematics, community
      ecology, and biogeography are also discussed.},

  abstract  = {Ecology Letters (2011) ABSTRACT: It is increasingly being
      recognized that global ecological research requires novel
      methods and strategies in which to combine process-based
      ecological models and data in cohesive, systematic ways.
      Model-data fusion (MDF) is an emerging area of research in
      ecology and palaeoecology. It provides a new quantitative
      approach that offers a high level of empirical constraint
      over model predictions based on observations using inverse
      modelling and data assimilation (DA) techniques. Increasing
      demands to integrate model and data methods in the past
      decade has led to MDF utilization in palaeoecology, ecology
      and earth system sciences. This paper reviews key features
      and principles of MDF and highlights different approaches
      with regards to DA. After providing a critical evaluation
      of the numerous benefits of MDF and its current
      applications in palaeoecology (i.e. palaeoclimatic
      reconstruction, palaeovegetation and palaeocarbon storage)
      and ecology (i.e. parameter and uncertainty estimation,
      model error identification, remote sensing and ecological
      forecasting), the paper discusses method limitations,
      current challenges and future research direction. In the
      ongoing data-rich era of today's world, MDF could become an
      important diagnostic and prognostic tool in which to
      improve our understanding of ecological processes while
      testing ecological theory and hypotheses and forecasting
      changes in ecosystem structure, function and services.},

  abstract  = {A characteristic signature of adaptive radiation is a
      slowing of the rate of speciation toward the present. On
      the basis of molecular phylogenies, studies of single
      clades have frequently found evidence for a slowdown in
      diversification rate and have interpreted this as evidence
      for density dependent speciation. However, we demonstrated
      via simulation that large clades are expected to show
      stronger slowdowns than small clades, even if the
      probability of speciation and extinction remains constant
      through time. This is a consequence of exponential growth:
      clades, which, by chance, diversify at above the average
      rate early in their history, will tend to be large. They
      will also tend to regress back to the average
      diversification rate later on, and therefore show a
      slowdown. We conducted a meta-analysis of the distribution
      of speciation events through time, focusing on
      sequence-based phylogenies for 45 clades of birds. Thirteen
      of the 23 clades (57\%) that include more than 20 species
      show significant slowdowns. The high frequency of slowdowns
      observed in large clades is even more extreme than expected
      under a purely stochastic constant-rate model, but is
      consistent with the adaptive radiation model. Taken
      together, our data strongly support a model of
      density-dependent speciation in birds, whereby speciation
      slows as ecological opportunities and geographical space
      place limits on clade growth.},

      likelihood (ML). Low-level technical optimizations, a
      modification of the search algorithm, and the use of the
      GTR+CAT approximation as replacement for GTR+Gamma yield a
      program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than the
      previous version of RAxML. A large-scale performance
      comparison with GARLI, PHYML, IQPNNI and MrBayes on real
      data containing 1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that RAxML
      requires at least 5.6 times less main memory and yields
      better trees in similar times than the best competing
      program (GARLI) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets >
      or =4000 taxa it also runs 2-3 times faster than GARLI.
      RAxML has been parallelized with MPI to conduct parallel
      multiple bootstraps and inferences on distinct starting
      trees. The program has been used to compute ML trees on two
      of the largest alignments to date containing 25,057 (1463
      bp) and 2182 (51,089 bp) taxa, respectively. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract  = {SUMMARY: DendroPy is a cross-platform library for the
      Python programming language that provides for
      object-oriented reading, writing, simulation, and
      manipulation of phylogenetic data, with an emphasis on
      phylogenetic tree operations. DendroPy uses a splits-hash
      mapping to perform rapid calculations of tree distances,
      similarities and shape under various metrics. It contains
      rich simulation routines to generate trees under a number
      of different phylogenetic and coalescent models. DendroPy's
      data simulation and manipulation facilities, in conjunction
      with its support of a broad range of phylogenetic data
      formats (NEXUS, Newick, PHYLIP, FASTA, NeXML, etc.), allow
      it to serve a useful role in various phyloinformatics and
      phylogeographic pipelines. AVAILABILITY: The stable release
      of the library is available for download and automated
      installation through the Python Package Index site
      (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/DendroPy), while the active
      development source code repository is available to the
      public from GitHub

@article{   warren2008,
  abstract  = {Environmental niche models, which are generated by
      combining species occurrence data with environmental GIS
      data layers, are increasingly used to answer fundamental
      questions about niche evolution, speciation, and the
      accumulation of ecological diversity within clades. The
      question of whether environmental niches are conserved over
      evolutionary time scales has attracted considerable
      attention, but often produced conflicting conclusions. This
      conflict, however, may result from differences in how niche
      similarity is measured and the specific null hypothesis
      being tested. We develop new methods for quantifying niche
      overlap that rely on a traditional ecological measure and a
      metric from mathematical statistics. We reexamine a classic
      study of niche conservatism between sister species in
      several groups of Mexican animals, and, for the first time,
      address alternative definitions of "niche conservatism"
      within a single framework using consistent methods. As
      expected, we find that environmental niches of sister
      species are more similar than expected under three distinct
      null hypotheses, but that they are rarely identical. We
      demonstrate how our measures can be used in phylogenetic
      comparative analyses by reexamining niche divergence in an
      adaptive radiation of Cuban anoles. Our results show that
      environmental niche overlap is closely tied to geographic
      overlap, but not to phylogenetic distances, suggesting that
      niche conservatism has not constrained local communities in
      this group to consist of closely related species. We
      suggest various randomization tests that may prove useful
      in other areas of ecology and evolutionary biology.},

      and trait data for communities of co-occurring species has
      created a need for software that integrates ecological and
      evolutionary analyses. Capabilities: Phylocom calculates
      numerous metrics of phylogenetic community structure and
      trait similarity within communities. Hypothesis testing is
      implemented using several null models. Within the same
      framework, it measures phylogenetic signal and correlated
      evolution for species traits. A range of utility functions
      allow community and phylogenetic data manipulation, tree
      and trait generation, and integration into scientific
      workflows. Availability: Open source at:
