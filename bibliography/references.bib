@Article{   butler2004,
  abstract  = {Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to
      study adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular
      methods model selection directly.We explain and develop a
      method based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first
      proposed by Hansen. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate
      both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively
      different from, and more general than, pure drift models
      based on Brownian motion. Most importantly,OU models
      possess selective optima that formalize the notion of
      adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for
      one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its
      parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our
      approach allows us to translate hy- potheses regarding
      adaptation in different selective regimes into ex- plicit
      models, to test the models against data using maximum-like-
      lihood-based model selection techniques, and to infer
      details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the
      method using two worked examples. Relative to existing
      approaches, the direct modeling ap- proach we demonstrate
      allows one to explore more detailed hy- potheses and to
      utilize more of the information content of com- parative
      data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a
      model selection framework to simultaneously compare a
      variety of hy- potheses advances our ability to assess
      alternative evolutionary explanations.},

@Article{   freckleton2002,
  abstract  = {The question is often raised whether it is statistically
      necessary to control for phylogenetic associations in
      comparative studies. To investigate this question, we
      explore the use of a measure of phylogenetic correlation,
      lambda, introduced by Pagel (1999), that normally varies
      between 0 (phylogenetic independence) and 1 (species'
      traits covary in direct proportion to their shared
      evolutionary history). Simulations show lambda to be a
      statistically powerful index for measuring whether data
      exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and whether it has
      low rates of Type I error. Moreover, lambda is robust to
      incomplete phylogenetic information, which demonstrates
      that even partial information on phylogeny will improve the
      accuracy of phylogenetic analyses. To assess whether traits
      generally show phylogenetic associations, we present a
      quantitative review of 26 published phylogenetic
      comparative data sets. The data sets include 103 traits and
      were chosen from the ecological literature in which debate
      about the need for phylogenetic correction has been most
      acute. Eighty-eight percent of data sets contained at least
      one character that displayed significant phylogenetic
      dependence, and 60\% of characters overall (pooled across
      studies) showed significant evidence of phylogenetic
      association. In 16\% of tests, phylogenetic correlation
      could be neither supported nor rejected. However, most of
      these equivocal results were found in small phylogenies and
      probably reflect a lack of power. We suggest that the
      parameter lambda be routinely estimated when analyzing
      comparative data, since it can also be used simultaneously
      to adjust the phylogenetic correction in a manner that is
      optimal for the data set, and we present an example of how
      this may be done.},
  annote  = {Notes on Pagel's Lambda:
      
      lambda = 1 means two traits perfectly correlated under
      brownian motion.
      
      is a multiplier of the correlation (off-diagonals)
      introduced by tree to otherwise independent random walks.
      hence 0 means that correlation is lost, whereas 1 means all
      the correlation is introduced by the tree, >1 means more
      corrleated than expected by tree alone -- i.e. the indep
      contrasts should also be correlated!
      
      Not a measure of phylogenetic signal, which should be
      defined for a single (scalar) trait. Also should be defined
      independent of brownian motion

      relationships and genetic variation of the bimaculatus
      group. Syst. Zool. 25:62-77.--Anolis lizards of the
      northern Lesser Antilles were studied with starch gel
      electrophoresis. A total of 22 genetic loci was analyzed
      for 15 populations. These data were used to estimate
      genetic distance between populations, and genetic variation
      within populations. Genetic distance estimates between
      populations are considerably lower than the estimates for
      the ecologically equivalent Anolis roquet species group of
      the southern Lesser Antilles. The relative proximity of
      islands in the northern part of the archipelago increases
      the probability of multiple colonizations, hence
      introgression, and a relatively slower rate of genetic
      divergence. The data also suggest that the northern
      bimaculatus group is evolutionarily younger than the roquet
      group, hence has had less time for genetic divergence.
      There is a geographic pattern discernible in the genetic
      distance data. One very tight cluster involves the
      southernmost populations studied from Dominica, Guadeloupe,
      Marie Gallante, and Montserrat; a second cluster includes
      more northern forms from Redonda, Saba, and St. Martin.
      Variability is lowest on the three smallest islands, but
      beyond that, there is no correlation between island size
      and heterozygosity. Relative degree of heterozygosity may
      be related to colonization history. Source populations tend
      to have higher variability than derived populations. The
      degree of genetic differentiation as estimated
      electrophoretically is very poorly correlated with
      differentiation for morphological characters such as body
      size, color, or pattern.},

  abstract  = {George Gaylord Simpson famously postulated that much of
      life's diversity originated as adaptive radiations-more or
      less simultaneous divergences of numerous lines from a
      single ancestral adaptive type. However, identifying
      adaptive radiations has proven difficult due to a lack of
      broad-scale comparative datasets. Here, we use phylogenetic
      comparative data on body size and shape in a diversity of
      animal clades to test a key model of adaptive radiation, in
      which initially rapid morphological evolution is followed
      by relative stasis. We compared the fit of this model to
      both single selective peak and random walk models. We found
      little support for the early-burst model of adaptive
      radiation, whereas both other models, particularly that of
      selective peaks, were commonly supported. In addition, we
      found that the net rate of morphological evolution varied
      inversely with clade age. The youngest clades appear to
      evolve most rapidly because long-term change typically does
      not attain the amount of divergence predicted from rates
      measured over short time scales. Across our entire
      analysis, the dominant pattern was one of constraints
      shaping evolution continually through time rather than
      rapid evolution followed by stasis. We suggest that the
      classical model of adaptive radiation, where morphological
      evolution is initially rapid and slows through time, may be
      rare in comparative data.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The past 30 years have seen a revolution in
      comparative biology. Before that time, systematics was not
      at the forefront of the biological sciences, and few
      scientists considered phylogenetic relationships when
      investigating evolutionary questions. By contrast,
      systematic biology is now one of the most vigorous
      disciplines in biology, and the use of phylogenies not only
      is requisite in macroevolutionary studies but also has been
      applied to a wide range of topics and fields that no one
      could possibly have envisioned 30 years ago. My message is
      simple: phylogenies are fundamental to comparative biology,
      but they are not the be-all and end-all. Phylogenies are
      powerful tools for understanding the past, but like any
      tool, they have their limitations. In addition, phylogenies
      are much more informative about pattern than they are about
      process. The best way to fully understand the past-both
      pattern and process-is to integrate phylogenies with other
      types of historical data as well as with direct studies of
      evolutionary process.},

  abstract  = {Aim: Provide a new multivariate hypothesis testing
      approach for the evolution of continuous characters in a
      phylogenetic context. Background: Brownian motion is the
      most commonly used model for the evolution of quantitative
      traits. Under multivariate Brownian motion, the evolution
      of multiple continuous traits can be described by an
      evolutionary rate matrix in which the diagonal elements
      determine the rate of evolution for individual characters,
      while the off-diagonal elements determine the extent to
      which different characters co-evolve. Method: We present
      likelihood tests for two simple hypotheses about the
      evolutionary rate matrix: (1) equality or proportionality
      to a hypothetical matrix; and (2) concerted change in the
      rate matrix in a certain portion or portions of the
      phylogenetic tree. In case (1), the hypothetical matrix
      might be estimated from the within-species additive genetic
      variance-covariance matrix. In case (2), concerted change
      in the evolutionary rate matrix might result from shifts in
      ploidy level or the mutation rate. We illustrate these
      hypothesis tests using data from individual-based
      quantitative genetic simulations on stochastic phylogenetic
      trees. Results: Our evolutionary rate matrix estimator
      exhibited minimal bias. Type I errors in our
      likelihood-based tests for matrix equality and
      proportionality were very close to appropriate levels.
      Power to detect selection was also sufficient, except in
      the case of the weakest selection simulated in this study.
      Type I error and the accuracy of parameter estimation in
      the test for rate matrix heterogeneity were also
      adequate.},

      1005 base pairs (bp) of mitochondrial DNA sequence data
      from two genes, cytochrome b (521 bp) and cytochrome
      oxidase subunit I (484 bp) to reconstruct phylogenetic
      relationships between species and populations of anoles
      from all islands banks. Allele frequency data from nuclear
      microsatellite loci are also analysed to assess their
      utility in uncovering historical relationships and provide
      independent corroboration for the mtDNA tree. Although the
      number of microsatellite loci used (six) was relatively
      small, some essential elements of the mitochondrial DNA
      phylogeny were recovered successfully. Anoles from Terre de
      Haut, Les Saintes, previously described as a subspecies of
      Anolis marmoratus, are shown to be more closely related to
      A. oculatus and their elevation to a full species, A.
      terraealtae, is supported. An island colonisation sequence
      inferred from the phylogeny shows a general pattern of
      North-to South colonisation. However, the Saban anole, A.
      sabanus, is shown to be derived from A. marmoratus
      populations from western Basse Terre following a
      longer-range, south to north translocation.},

  abstract  = {Regime shifts are substantial, long-lasting
      reorganizations of complex systems, such as ecosystems.
      Large ecosystem changes such as eutrophication, shifts
      among vegetation types, degradation of coral reefs and
      regional climate change often come as surprises because we
      lack leading indicators for regime shifts. Increases in
      variability of ecosystems have been suggested to foreshadow
      ecological regime shifts. However, it may be difficult to
      discern variability due to impending regime shift from that
      of exogenous drivers that affect the ecosystem. We
      addressed this problem using a model of lake
      eutrophication. Lakes are subject to fluctuations in
      recycling associated with regime shifts, as well as
      fluctuating nutrient inputs. Despite the complications of
      noisy inputs, increasing variability of lake-water
      phosphorus was discernible prior to the shift to eutrophic
      conditions. Simulations show that rising standard deviation
      (SD) could signal impending shifts about a decade in
      advance. The rising SD was detected by studying variability
      around predictions of a simple time-series model, and did
      not depend on detailed knowledge of the actual ecosystem
      dynamics.},

@Article{   Dakos2008,
  abstract  = {In the Earth's history, periods of relatively stable
      climate have often been interrupted by sharp transitions to
      a contrasting state. One explanation for such events of
      abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system
      reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains
      hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even
      more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a
      tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future.
      Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and
      show that they were all preceded by a characteristic
      slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the
      actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased
      autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a
      hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply
      independent empirical evidence for the idea that past
      abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical
      thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is
      fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that
      our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal
      early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change.
      Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex
      systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this
      is a promising perspective.},

  abstract  = {Humans and climate affect ecosystems and their services,
      which may involve continuous and discontinuous transitions
      from one stable state to another. Discontinuous transitions
      are abrupt, irreversible and among the most catastrophic
      changes of ecosystems identified. For terrestrial
      ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation
      patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent
      transitions. Here, we analyse how vegetation patchiness
      changes in arid ecosystems with different grazing
      pressures, using both field data and a modelling approach.
      In the modelling approach, we extrapolated our analysis to
      even higher grazing pressures to investigate the vegetation
      patchiness when desertification is imminent. In three arid
      Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain, Greece and Morocco, we
      found that the patch-size distribution of the vegetation
      follows a power law. Using a stochastic cellular automaton
      model, we show that local positive interactions among
      plants can explain such power-law distributions.
      Furthermore, with increasing grazing pressure, the field
      data revealed consistent deviations from power laws.
      Increased grazing pressure leads to similar deviations in
      the model. When grazing was further increased in the model,
      we found that these deviations always and only occurred
      close to transition to desert, independent of the type of
      transition, and regardless of the vegetation cover.
      Therefore, we propose that patch-size distributions may be
      a warning signal for the onset of desertification.},

  abstract  = {The deteriorating health of the world's coral reefs
      threatens global biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the
      livelihoods of millions of people living in tropical
      coastal regions. Reefs in the Caribbean are among the most
      heavily affected, having experienced mass disease-induced
      mortality of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum in
      1983 and two framework-building species of coral. Declining
      reef health is characterized by increases in macroalgae. A
      critical question is whether the observed macroalgal bloom
      on Caribbean reefs is easily reversible. To answer this
      question, we must resolve whether algal-dominated reefs are
      an alternative stable state of the ecosystem or simply the
      readily reversible result of a phase change along a
      gradient of some environmental or ecological parameter.
      Here, using a fully parameterized simulation model in
      combination with a simple analytical model, we show that
      Caribbean reefs became susceptible to alternative stable
      states once the urchin mortality event of 1983 confined the
      majority of grazing to parrotfishes. We reveal dramatic
      hysteresis in a natural system and define critical
      thresholds of grazing and coral cover beyond which
      resilience is lost. Most grazing thresholds lie near the
      upper level observed for parrotfishes in nature, suggesting
      that reefs are highly sensitive to parrotfish exploitation.
      Ecosystem thresholds can be combined with stochastic models
      of disturbance to identify targets for the restoration of
      ecosystem processes. We illustrate this principle by
      estimating the relationship between current reef state
      (coral cover and grazing) and the probability that the reef
      will withstand moderate hurricane intensity for two decades
      without becoming entrained in a shift towards a stable
      macroalgal-dominated state. Such targets may help reef
      managers face the challenge of addressing global
      disturbance at local scales.},

      nutrient loading, habitat fragmentation or biotic
      exploitation. Nature is usually assumed to respond to
      gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes,
      coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that
      smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches
      to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger
      such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience

      This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of

      alternative stable states is often referred to as
      "ecological resilience." Ecosystems with a low ecological
      resilience may easily be tipped into an alternative basin
      of attraction by a stochastic event. Unfortunately, it is
      very difficult to measure ecological resilience in
      practice. Here we show that the rate of recovery from small
      perturbations (sometimes called "engineering resilience")
      is a remarkably good indicator of ecological resilience.
      Such recovery rates decrease as a catastrophic regime shift
      is approached, a phenomenon known in physics as "critical
      slowing down." We demonstrate the robust occurrence of
      critical slowing down in six ecological models and outline
      a possible experimental approach to quantify differences in
      recovery rates. In all the models we analyzed, critical
      slowing down becomes apparent quite far from a threshold
      point, suggesting that it may indeed be of practical use as
      an early warning signal. Despite the fact that critical
      slowing down could also indicate other critical
      transitions, such as a stable system becoming oscillatory,
      the robustness of the phenomenon makes it a promising
      indicator of loss of resilience and the risk of upcoming
      regime shifts in a system.},

  abstract  = {Ecological regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting
      changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts
      on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional
      regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but
      prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously
      difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in
      ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and
      autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning
      indicators of impending shifts. A critical question,
      however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient
      warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We
      examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime
      shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or
      shoreline development (only gradual restoration is
      possible). The model represents key features of a broad
      class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers
      can only be manipulated gradually management action is
      needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if
      drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be
      delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the
      indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated,
      often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve
      usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that
      research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather
      than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical
      indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem
      attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio
      indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is
      also dependent on developing policy processes that enable
      society to respond more rapidly to information about
      impending regime shifts.},

  abstract  = {Because novel ecological conditions can cause severe and
      long-lasting environmental damage with large economic
      costs, ecologists must identify possible environmental
      regime shifts and pro-actively guide ecosystem management.
      As an illustrative example, we applied six potential
      indicators of impending regime shifts to S. R. Carpenter
      and W. A. Brock's model of lake eutrophication and analyzed
      whether or not they afforded adequate advance warning to
      enable preventative interventions. Our initial analyses
      suggest that an indicator based on the high-frequency
      signal in the spectral density of the time-series provides
      the best advance warning of a regime shift, even when only
      incomplete information about underlying system drivers and
      processes is available. In light of this result, we
      explored two key factors associated with using indicators
      to prevent regime shifts. The first key factor is the
      amount of inertia in the system; i.e., how fast the system
      will react to a change in management, given that a manager
      can actually control relevant system drivers. If rapid,
      intensive management is possible, our analyses suggest that
      an indicator must provide at least 20 years advance warning
      to reduce the probability of a regime shift to < 5\%. As
      time to intervention is increased or intensity of
      intervention is decreased, the necessary amount of advance
      warning required to avoid a regime shift increases
      exponentially. The second key factor concerns the amount
      and type of variability intrinsic to the system, and the
      impact of this variability on the power of an indicator.
      Indicators are considered powerful if they detect an
      impending regime shift with adequate lead time for
      effective management intervention, but not so far in
      advance that interventions are too costly or unnecessary.
      Intrinsic "noise" in the system obscures the "signal"
      provided by all indicators, and therefore, the power of the
      indicators declines rapidly with increasing within- and
      between-year variability in measurable variables or
      parameters. Our results highlight the key role of human
      decisions in managing ecosystems and the importance of
      pro-active application of the precautionary principle to
      avoid regime shifts.},

  abstract  = {In the Earth's history, periods of relatively stable
      climate have often been interrupted by sharp transitions to
      a contrasting state. One explanation for such events of
      abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system
      reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains
      hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even
      more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a
      tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future.
      Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and
      show that they were all preceded by a characteristic
      slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the
      actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased
      autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a
      hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply
      independent empirical evidence for the idea that past
      abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical
      thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is
      fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that
      our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal
      early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change.
      Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex
      systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this
      is a promising perspective.},

      stable state. It is shown that changes in asymmetry in the

      signal for both routes to regime shifts. Furthermore, using
      model simulations that mimic field measurements and a

      ecological systems that will exhibit leading indicators of
      regime shifts is limited, and that there is a set of
      ecological models and, therefore, also likely to be a class
      of natural systems for which there will be no forewarning
      of a regime change. We first describe how nonlinearities in
      combination with environmental variability lead to model
      descriptions that will not have smooth potentials,
      concluding that many ecological systems are described by
      systems without smooth potentials and thus will not show
      typical leading indicators of regime shifts. We then
      illustrate the impact of these general arguments by
      numerically examining the dynamics of several model
      ecological systems under slowly changing conditions. Our
      results offer a cautionary note about the generality of

  abstract  = {Humans and climate affect ecosystems and their services,
      which may involve continuous and discontinuous transitions
      from one stable state to another. Discontinuous transitions
      are abrupt, irreversible and among the most catastrophic
      changes of ecosystems identified. For terrestrial
      ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation
      patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent
      transitions. Here, we analyse how vegetation patchiness
      changes in arid ecosystems with different grazing
      pressures, using both field data and a modelling approach.
      In the modelling approach, we extrapolated our analysis to
      even higher grazing pressures to investigate the vegetation
      patchiness when desertification is imminent. In three arid
      Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain, Greece and Morocco, we
      found that the patch-size distribution of the vegetation
      follows a power law. Using a stochastic cellular automaton
      model, we show that local positive interactions among
      plants can explain such power-law distributions.
      Furthermore, with increasing grazing pressure, the field
      data revealed consistent deviations from power laws.
      Increased grazing pressure leads to similar deviations in

@Article{   kuehn2011,
  abstract  = {Critical transitions occur in a wide variety of
      applications including mathematical biology, climate
      change, human physiology and economics. A dynamical system
      that was in a stable state suddenly changes to a distant
      attractor. Therefore it is highly desirable to find
      early-warning signs for these critical transitions.
      Although several different approaches have been proposed
      for specific models, a detailed mathematical theory has not
      been developed yet. In this paper we provide another
      building block of this theory beyond the first results
      developed in [C. Kuehn. "A mathematical framework for
      critical transitions: bifurcations, fast-slow systems and
      stochastic dynamics", submitted, 2010]. We start from
      classical bifurcation theory and normal forms to classify
      critical transitions. Using this approach, we proceed to
      stochastic fluctuations and provided detailed scaling laws
      of the variance of stochastic sample paths near critical
      transitions. To show that our theory naturally extends
      bifurcation theory we apply it to several models: the
      Stommel-Cessi box model for the thermohaline circulation
      from geoscience, an epidemic-spreading model on an adaptive
      network, an activator-inhibitor switch from systems
      biology, a predator-prey system from ecology and to the
      Euler buckling problem from classical mechanics. We also
      hope that our combination of theory and applications for
      critical transitions opens up new research directions in
      different disciplines of nonlinear science.},

  abstract  = {We have used the Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system
      modelling framework to study the archetypal example of a
      tipping point in the climate system; a threshold for the
      collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC).
      eScience has been invaluable in this work and we explain
      how we have made it work for us. Two stable states of the
      THC have been found to coexist, under the same boundary
      conditions, in a hierarchy of models. The climate forcing
      required to collapse the THC and the reversibility or
      irreversibility of such a collapse depends on uncertain
      model parameters. Automated methods have been used to
      assimilate observational data to constrain the pertinent
      parameters. Anthropogenic climate forcing leads to a robust
      weakening of the THC and increases the probability of
      crossing a THC tipping point, but some ensemble members
      collapse readily, whereas others are extremely resistant.
      Hence, we test general methods that have been developed to
      directly diagnose, from time-series data, the proximity of
      a 'tipping element', such as the THC to a bifurcation
      point. In a three-dimensional ocean-atmosphere model
      exhibiting THC hysteresis, despite high variability in the
      THC driven by the dynamical atmosphere, some early warning
      of an approaching tipping point appears possible.},

  abstract  = {The deteriorating health of the world's coral reefs
      threatens global biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the
      livelihoods of millions of people living in tropical
      coastal regions. Reefs in the Caribbean are among the most
      heavily affected, having experienced mass disease-induced
      mortality of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum in
      1983 and two framework-building species of coral. Declining
      reef health is characterized by increases in macroalgae. A
      critical question is whether the observed macroalgal bloom
      on Caribbean reefs is easily reversible. To answer this
      question, we must resolve whether algal-dominated reefs are
      an alternative stable state of the ecosystem or simply the
      readily reversible result of a phase change along a
      gradient of some environmental or ecological parameter.
      Here, using a fully parameterized simulation model in
      combination with a simple analytical model, we show that
      Caribbean reefs became susceptible to alternative stable
      states once the urchin mortality event of 1983 confined the
      majority of grazing to parrotfishes. We reveal dramatic
      hysteresis in a natural system and define critical
      thresholds of grazing and coral cover beyond which
      resilience is lost. Most grazing thresholds lie near the
      upper level observed for parrotfishes in nature, suggesting
      that reefs are highly sensitive to parrotfish exploitation.
      Ecosystem thresholds can be combined with stochastic models
      of disturbance to identify targets for the restoration of
      ecosystem processes. We illustrate this principle by
      estimating the relationship between current reef state
      (coral cover and grazing) and the probability that the reef
      will withstand moderate hurricane intensity for two decades
      without becoming entrained in a shift towards a stable
      macroalgal-dominated state. Such targets may help reef
      managers face the challenge of addressing global
      disturbance at local scales.},

      can lead to dramatic and abrupt regime shifts across
      different ecosystems, hysteresis and counterintuitive
      changes in the consumer abundances. Whether these counter
      intuitive or abrupt responses occur depend on the relative
      productivity of both habitats and which consumer life-stage
      inhabits the manipulated ecosystem. These results
      demonstrate the strong yet complex interactions between
      ecosystems coupled through consumers with CLC and the need
      to think across ecosystems to reliably predict the
      consequences of natural or anthropogenic changes.},

@Article{   seekell2011,
  abstract  = {Abstract Regime shifts are massive, often irreversible,
      rearrangements of nonlinear ecological processes that occur
      when systems pass critical transition points. Ecological
      regime shifts sometimes have severe consequences for human
      well-being, including eutrophication in lakes,
      desertification, and species extinctions. Theoretical and
      laboratory evidence suggests that statistical anomalies may
      be detectable leading indicators of regime shifts in
      ecological time series, making it possible to foresee and
      potentially avert incipient regime shifts. Conditional
      heteroscedasticity is persistent variance characteristic of
      time series with clustered volatility. Here, we analyze
      conditional heteroscedasticity as a potential leading
      indicator of regime shifts in ecological time series. We
      evaluate conditional heteroscedasticity by using ecological
      models with and without four types of critical transition.
      On approaching transition points, all time series contain
      significant conditional heteroscedasticity. This signal is
      detected hundreds of time steps in advance of the regime
      shift. Time series without regime shifts do not have
      significant conditional heteroscedasticity. Because
      probability values are easily associated with tests for
      conditional heteroscedasticity, detection of false
      positives in time series without regime shifts is
      minimized. This property reduces the need for a reference
      system to compare with the perturbed system.},
