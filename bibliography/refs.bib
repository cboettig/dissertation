		  Managing for improved resilience, incorporating the role of

		  coping with uncertainty, future changes and ecological

		  functional groups (for both corals and reef fishes) that

		  phase shifts from coral dominance to less desirable,
		  degraded ecosystems. We identify striking biogeographic
		  differences in the species richness and composition of
		  functional groups, which highlight the vulnerability of
		  Caribbean reef ecosystems. These findings have profound
		  implications for restoration of degraded reefs, management
		  of fisheries, and the focus on marine protected areas and
		  biodiversity hotspots as priorities for conservation.},

@Article{	  biggs2009,
  abstract	= {Ecological regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting
		  changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts
		  on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional
		  regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but
		  prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously
		  difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in
		  ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and
		  autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning
		  indicators of impending shifts. A critical question,
		  however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient
		  warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We
		  examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime
		  shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or
		  shoreline development (only gradual restoration is
		  possible). The model represents key features of a broad
		  class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers
		  can only be manipulated gradually management action is
		  needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if
		  drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be
		  delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the
		  indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated,
		  often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve
		  usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that
		  research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather
		  than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical
		  indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem
		  attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio
		  indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is
		  also dependent on developing policy processes that enable
		  society to respond more rapidly to information about
		  impending regime shifts.},

  abstract	= {The increasing use of computer simulation by theoretical
		  ecologists started a move away from models formulated at

		  However, many of the models studied at the individual level
		  are not analysed mathematically and remain defined in terms

		  they are intrinsically stochastic and require tools and

  abstract	= {Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to
		  study adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular
		  methods model selection directly.We explain and develop a
		  method based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first
		  proposed by Hansen. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate
		  both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively
		  different from, and more general than, pure drift models
		  based on Brownian motion. Most importantly,OU models
		  possess selective optima that formalize the notion of
		  adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for
		  one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its
		  parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our
		  approach allows us to translate hy- potheses regarding
		  adaptation in different selective regimes into ex- plicit
		  models, to test the models against data using maximum-like-
		  lihood-based model selection techniques, and to infer
		  details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the
		  method using two worked examples. Relative to existing
		  approaches, the direct modeling ap- proach we demonstrate
		  allows one to explore more detailed hy- potheses and to
		  utilize more of the information content of com- parative
		  data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a
		  model selection framework to simultaneously compare a
		  variety of hy- potheses advances our ability to assess
		  alternative evolutionary explanations.},

  abstract	= {Regime shifts are substantial, long-lasting
		  reorganizations of complex systems, such as ecosystems.
		  Large ecosystem changes such as eutrophication, shifts
		  among vegetation types, degradation of coral reefs and
		  regional climate change often come as surprises because we
		  lack leading indicators for regime shifts. Increases in
		  variability of ecosystems have been suggested to foreshadow
		  ecological regime shifts. However, it may be difficult to
		  discern variability due to impending regime shift from that
		  of exogenous drivers that affect the ecosystem. We
		  addressed this problem using a model of lake
		  eutrophication. Lakes are subject to fluctuations in
		  recycling associated with regime shifts, as well as
		  fluctuating nutrient inputs. Despite the complications of
		  noisy inputs, increasing variability of lake-water
		  phosphorus was discernible prior to the shift to eutrophic
		  conditions. Simulations show that rising standard deviation
		  (SD) could signal impending shifts about a decade in
		  advance. The rising SD was detected by studying variability
		  around predictions of a simple time-series model, and did
		  not depend on detailed knowledge of the actual ecosystem
		  dynamics.},

  abstract	= {Because novel ecological conditions can cause severe and
		  long-lasting environmental damage with large economic
		  costs, ecologists must identify possible environmental
		  regime shifts and pro-actively guide ecosystem management.
		  As an illustrative example, we applied six potential
		  indicators of impending regime shifts to S. R. Carpenter
		  and W. A. Brock's model of lake eutrophication and analyzed
		  whether or not they afforded adequate advance warning to
		  enable preventative interventions. Our initial analyses
		  suggest that an indicator based on the high-frequency
		  signal in the spectral density of the time-series provides
		  the best advance warning of a regime shift, even when only
		  incomplete information about underlying system drivers and
		  processes is available. In light of this result, we
		  explored two key factors associated with using indicators
		  to prevent regime shifts. The first key factor is the
		  amount of inertia in the system; i.e., how fast the system
		  will react to a change in management, given that a manager
		  can actually control relevant system drivers. If rapid,
		  intensive management is possible, our analyses suggest that
		  an indicator must provide at least 20 years advance warning
		  to reduce the probability of a regime shift to < 5\%. As
		  time to intervention is increased or intensity of
		  intervention is decreased, the necessary amount of advance
		  warning required to avoid a regime shift increases
		  exponentially. The second key factor concerns the amount
		  and type of variability intrinsic to the system, and the
		  impact of this variability on the power of an indicator.
		  Indicators are considered powerful if they detect an
		  impending regime shift with adequate lead time for
		  effective management intervention, but not so far in
		  advance that interventions are too costly or unnecessary.
		  Intrinsic "noise" in the system obscures the "signal"
		  provided by all indicators, and therefore, the power of the
		  indicators declines rapidly with increasing within- and
		  between-year variability in measurable variables or
		  parameters. Our results highlight the key role of human
		  decisions in managing ecosystems and the importance of
		  pro-active application of the precautionary principle to
		  avoid regime shifts.},

  abstract	= {In the Earth's history, periods of relatively stable
		  climate have often been interrupted by sharp transitions to
		  a contrasting state. One explanation for such events of
		  abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system
		  reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains
		  hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even
		  more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a
		  tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future.
		  Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and
		  show that they were all preceded by a characteristic
		  slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the
		  actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased
		  autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a
		  hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply
		  independent empirical evidence for the idea that past
		  abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical
		  thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is
		  fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that
		  our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal
		  early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change.
		  Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex
		  systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this
		  is a promising perspective.},

		  between 0 (phylogenetic independence) and 1 (species'
		  traits covary in direct proportion to their shared
		  evolutionary history). Simulations show lambda to be a
		  statistically powerful index for measuring whether data
		  exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and whether it has
		  low rates of Type I error. Moreover, lambda is robust to
		  incomplete phylogenetic information, which demonstrates
		  that even partial information on phylogeny will improve the
		  accuracy of phylogenetic analyses. To assess whether traits
		  generally show phylogenetic associations, we present a
		  quantitative review of 26 published phylogenetic
		  comparative data sets. The data sets include 103 traits and
		  were chosen from the ecological literature in which debate
		  about the need for phylogenetic correction has been most
		  acute. Eighty-eight percent of data sets contained at least
		  one character that displayed significant phylogenetic
		  dependence, and 60\% of characters overall (pooled across
		  studies) showed significant evidence of phylogenetic
		  association. In 16\% of tests, phylogenetic correlation
		  could be neither supported nor rejected. However, most of
		  these equivocal results were found in small phylogenies and
		  probably reflect a lack of power. We suggest that the
		  parameter lambda be routinely estimated when analyzing
		  comparative data, since it can also be used simultaneously
		  to adjust the phylogenetic correction in a manner that is
		  optimal for the data set, and we present an example of how
		  this may be done.},
  annote	= {Notes on Pagel's Lambda:
		  
		  lambda = 1 means two traits perfectly correlated under
		  brownian motion.
		  
		  is a multiplier of the correlation (off-diagonals)
		  introduced by tree to otherwise independent random walks.
		  hence 0 means that correlation is lost, whereas 1 means all
		  the correlation is introduced by the tree, >1 means more
		  corrleated than expected by tree alone -- i.e. the indep
		  contrasts should also be correlated!
		  
		  Not a measure of phylogenetic signal, which should be
		  defined for a single (scalar) trait. Also should be defined
		  independent of brownian motion

		  relationships and genetic variation of the bimaculatus
		  group. Syst. Zool. 25:62-77.--Anolis lizards of the
		  northern Lesser Antilles were studied with starch gel
		  electrophoresis. A total of 22 genetic loci was analyzed
		  for 15 populations. These data were used to estimate
		  genetic distance between populations, and genetic variation
		  within populations. Genetic distance estimates between
		  populations are considerably lower than the estimates for
		  the ecologically equivalent Anolis roquet species group of
		  the southern Lesser Antilles. The relative proximity of
		  islands in the northern part of the archipelago increases
		  the probability of multiple colonizations, hence
		  introgression, and a relatively slower rate of genetic
		  divergence. The data also suggest that the northern
		  bimaculatus group is evolutionarily younger than the roquet
		  group, hence has had less time for genetic divergence.
		  There is a geographic pattern discernible in the genetic
		  distance data. One very tight cluster involves the
		  southernmost populations studied from Dominica, Guadeloupe,
		  Marie Gallante, and Montserrat; a second cluster includes
		  more northern forms from Redonda, Saba, and St. Martin.
		  Variability is lowest on the three smallest islands, but
		  beyond that, there is no correlation between island size
		  and heterozygosity. Relative degree of heterozygosity may
		  be related to colonization history. Source populations tend
		  to have higher variability than derived populations. The
		  degree of genetic differentiation as estimated
		  electrophoretically is very poorly correlated with
		  differentiation for morphological characters such as body
		  size, color, or pattern.},

		  animal clades to test a key model of adaptive radiation, in
		  which initially rapid morphological evolution is followed
		  by relative stasis. We compared the fit of this model to
		  both single selective peak and random walk models. We found
		  little support for the early-burst model of adaptive
		  radiation, whereas both other models, particularly that of
		  selective peaks, were commonly supported. In addition, we
		  found that the net rate of morphological evolution varied
		  inversely with clade age. The youngest clades appear to
		  evolve most rapidly because long-term change typically does
		  not attain the amount of divergence predicted from rates
		  measured over short time scales. Across our entire
		  analysis, the dominant pattern was one of constraints
		  shaping evolution continually through time rather than
		  rapid evolution followed by stasis. We suggest that the
		  classical model of adaptive radiation, where morphological
		  evolution is initially rapid and slows through time, may be
		  rare in comparative data.},

		  concluding that many ecological systems are described by
		  systems without smooth potentials and thus will not show
		  typical leading indicators of regime shifts. We then
		  illustrate the impact of these general arguments by
		  numerically examining the dynamics of several model
		  ecological systems under slowly changing conditions. Our
		  results offer a cautionary note about the generality of

  abstract	= {Humans and climate affect ecosystems and their services,
		  which may involve continuous and discontinuous transitions
		  from one stable state to another. Discontinuous transitions
		  are abrupt, irreversible and among the most catastrophic
		  changes of ecosystems identified. For terrestrial
		  ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation
		  patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent
		  transitions. Here, we analyse how vegetation patchiness
		  changes in arid ecosystems with different grazing
		  pressures, using both field data and a modelling approach.
		  In the modelling approach, we extrapolated our analysis to
		  even higher grazing pressures to investigate the vegetation
		  patchiness when desertification is imminent. In three arid
		  Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain, Greece and Morocco, we
		  found that the patch-size distribution of the vegetation
		  follows a power law. Using a stochastic cellular automaton
		  model, we show that local positive interactions among
		  plants can explain such power-law distributions.
		  Furthermore, with increasing grazing pressure, the field
		  data revealed consistent deviations from power laws.
		  Increased grazing pressure leads to similar deviations in
		  the model. When grazing was further increased in the model,
		  we found that these deviations always and only occurred
		  close to transition to desert, independent of the type of
		  transition, and regardless of the vegetation cover.
		  Therefore, we propose that patch-size distributions may be
		  a warning signal for the onset of desertification.},

  abstract	= {Critical transitions occur in a wide variety of
		  applications including mathematical biology, climate
		  change, human physiology and economics. A dynamical system
		  that was in a stable state suddenly changes to a distant
		  attractor. Therefore it is highly desirable to find
		  early-warning signs for these critical transitions.
		  Although several different approaches have been proposed
		  for specific models, a detailed mathematical theory has not
		  been developed yet. In this paper we provide another
		  building block of this theory beyond the first results
		  developed in [C. Kuehn. "A mathematical framework for
		  critical transitions: bifurcations, fast-slow systems and
		  stochastic dynamics", submitted, 2010]. We start from
		  classical bifurcation theory and normal forms to classify
		  critical transitions. Using this approach, we proceed to
		  stochastic fluctuations and provided detailed scaling laws
		  of the variance of stochastic sample paths near critical
		  transitions. To show that our theory naturally extends
		  bifurcation theory we apply it to several models: the
		  Stommel-Cessi box model for the thermohaline circulation
		  from geoscience, an epidemic-spreading model on an adaptive
		  network, an activator-inhibitor switch from systems
		  biology, a predator-prey system from ecology and to the
		  Euler buckling problem from classical mechanics. We also
		  hope that our combination of theory and applications for
		  critical transitions opens up new research directions in
		  different disciplines of nonlinear science.},

  abstract	= {We have used the Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system
		  modelling framework to study the archetypal example of a
		  tipping point in the climate system; a threshold for the
		  collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC).
		  eScience has been invaluable in this work and we explain
		  how we have made it work for us. Two stable states of the
		  THC have been found to coexist, under the same boundary
		  conditions, in a hierarchy of models. The climate forcing
		  required to collapse the THC and the reversibility or
		  irreversibility of such a collapse depends on uncertain
		  model parameters. Automated methods have been used to
		  assimilate observational data to constrain the pertinent
		  parameters. Anthropogenic climate forcing leads to a robust
		  weakening of the THC and increases the probability of
		  crossing a THC tipping point, but some ensemble members
		  collapse readily, whereas others are extremely resistant.
		  Hence, we test general methods that have been developed to
		  directly diagnose, from time-series data, the proximity of
		  a 'tipping element', such as the THC to a bifurcation
		  point. In a three-dimensional ocean-atmosphere model
		  exhibiting THC hysteresis, despite high variability in the
		  THC driven by the dynamical atmosphere, some early warning
		  of an approaching tipping point appears possible.},

		  at the forefront of the biological sciences, and few
		  scientists considered phylogenetic relationships when
		  investigating evolutionary questions. By contrast,
		  systematic biology is now one of the most vigorous
		  disciplines in biology, and the use of phylogenies not only
		  is requisite in macroevolutionary studies but also has been
		  applied to a wide range of topics and fields that no one
		  could possibly have envisioned 30 years ago. My message is
		  simple: phylogenies are fundamental to comparative biology,
		  but they are not the be-all and end-all. Phylogenies are
		  powerful tools for understanding the past, but like any
		  tool, they have their limitations. In addition, phylogenies
		  are much more informative about pattern than they are about
		  process. The best way to fully understand the past-both
		  pattern and process-is to integrate phylogenies with other
		  types of historical data as well as with direct studies of
		  evolutionary process.},

  abstract	= {The deteriorating health of the world's coral reefs
		  threatens global biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the
		  livelihoods of millions of people living in tropical
		  coastal regions. Reefs in the Caribbean are among the most
		  heavily affected, having experienced mass disease-induced
		  mortality of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum in
		  1983 and two framework-building species of coral. Declining
		  reef health is characterized by increases in macroalgae. A
		  critical question is whether the observed macroalgal bloom
		  on Caribbean reefs is easily reversible. To answer this
		  question, we must resolve whether algal-dominated reefs are
		  an alternative stable state of the ecosystem or simply the
		  readily reversible result of a phase change along a
		  gradient of some environmental or ecological parameter.
		  Here, using a fully parameterized simulation model in
		  combination with a simple analytical model, we show that
		  Caribbean reefs became susceptible to alternative stable
		  states once the urchin mortality event of 1983 confined the
		  majority of grazing to parrotfishes. We reveal dramatic
		  hysteresis in a natural system and define critical
		  thresholds of grazing and coral cover beyond which
		  resilience is lost. Most grazing thresholds lie near the
		  upper level observed for parrotfishes in nature, suggesting
		  that reefs are highly sensitive to parrotfish exploitation.
		  Ecosystem thresholds can be combined with stochastic models
		  of disturbance to identify targets for the restoration of
		  ecosystem processes. We illustrate this principle by
		  estimating the relationship between current reef state
		  (coral cover and grazing) and the probability that the reef
		  will withstand moderate hurricane intensity for two decades
		  without becoming entrained in a shift towards a stable
		  macroalgal-dominated state. Such targets may help reef
		  managers face the challenge of addressing global
		  disturbance at local scales.},

  abstract	= {Aim: Provide a new multivariate hypothesis testing
		  approach for the evolution of continuous characters in a
		  phylogenetic context. Background: Brownian motion is the
		  most commonly used model for the evolution of quantitative
		  traits. Under multivariate Brownian motion, the evolution
		  of multiple continuous traits can be described by an
		  evolutionary rate matrix in which the diagonal elements
		  determine the rate of evolution for individual characters,
		  while the off-diagonal elements determine the extent to
		  which different characters co-evolve. Method: We present
		  likelihood tests for two simple hypotheses about the
		  evolutionary rate matrix: (1) equality or proportionality
		  to a hypothetical matrix; and (2) concerted change in the
		  rate matrix in a certain portion or portions of the
		  phylogenetic tree. In case (1), the hypothetical matrix
		  might be estimated from the within-species additive genetic
		  variance-covariance matrix. In case (2), concerted change
		  in the evolutionary rate matrix might result from shifts in
		  ploidy level or the mutation rate. We illustrate these
		  hypothesis tests using data from individual-based
		  quantitative genetic simulations on stochastic phylogenetic
		  trees. Results: Our evolutionary rate matrix estimator
		  exhibited minimal bias. Type I errors in our
		  likelihood-based tests for matrix equality and
		  proportionality were very close to appropriate levels.
		  Power to detect selection was also sufficient, except in
		  the case of the weakest selection simulated in this study.
		  Type I error and the accuracy of parameter estimation in
		  the test for rate matrix heterogeneity were also
		  adequate.},

  abstract	= {Abstract Regime shifts are massive, often irreversible,
		  rearrangements of nonlinear ecological processes that occur
		  when systems pass critical transition points. Ecological
		  regime shifts sometimes have severe consequences for human
		  well-being, including eutrophication in lakes,
		  desertification, and species extinctions. Theoretical and
		  laboratory evidence suggests that statistical anomalies may
		  be detectable leading indicators of regime shifts in
		  ecological time series, making it possible to foresee and
		  potentially avert incipient regime shifts. Conditional
		  heteroscedasticity is persistent variance characteristic of
		  time series with clustered volatility. Here, we analyze
		  conditional heteroscedasticity as a potential leading
		  indicator of regime shifts in ecological time series. We
		  evaluate conditional heteroscedasticity by using ecological

		  On approaching transition points, all time series contain

  abstract	= {The size of the basin of attraction in ecosystems with
		  alternative stable states is often referred to as
		  "ecological resilience." Ecosystems with a low ecological
		  resilience may easily be tipped into an alternative basin
		  of attraction by a stochastic event. Unfortunately, it is
		  very difficult to measure ecological resilience in
		  practice. Here we show that the rate of recovery from small
		  perturbations (sometimes called "engineering resilience")
		  is a remarkably good indicator of ecological resilience.
		  Such recovery rates decrease as a catastrophic regime shift
		  is approached, a phenomenon known in physics as "critical
		  slowing down." We demonstrate the robust occurrence of
		  critical slowing down in six ecological models and outline
		  a possible experimental approach to quantify differences in
		  recovery rates. In all the models we analyzed, critical
		  slowing down becomes apparent quite far from a threshold
		  point, suggesting that it may indeed be of practical use as
		  an early warning signal. Despite the fact that critical
		  slowing down could also indicate other critical
		  transitions, such as a stable system becoming oscillatory,
		  the robustness of the phenomenon makes it a promising
		  indicator of loss of resilience and the risk of upcoming
		  regime shifts in a system.},
