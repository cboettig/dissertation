  abstract	= {The worldwide decline of coral reefs calls for an urgent
		  reassessment of current management practices. Confronting
		  large-scale crises requires a major scaling-up of
		  management efforts based on an improved understanding of
		  the ecological processes that underlie reef resilience.
		  Managing for improved resilience, incorporating the role of
		  human activity in shaping ecosystems, provides a basis for
		  coping with uncertainty, future changes and ecological
		  surprises. Here we review the ecological roles of critical
		  functional groups (for both corals and reef fishes) that
		  are fundamental to understanding resilience and avoiding
		  phase shifts from coral dominance to less desirable,
		  degraded ecosystems. We identify striking biogeographic
		  differences in the species richness and composition of
		  functional groups, which highlight the vulnerability of
		  Caribbean reef ecosystems. These findings have profound
		  implications for restoration of degraded reefs, management
		  of fisheries, and the focus on marine protected areas and
		  biodiversity hotspots as priorities for conservation.},

  abstract	= {Ecological regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting
		  changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts
		  on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional
		  regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but
		  prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously
		  difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in
		  ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and
		  autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning
		  indicators of impending shifts. A critical question,
		  however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient
		  warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We
		  examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime
		  shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or
		  shoreline development (only gradual restoration is
		  possible). The model represents key features of a broad
		  class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers
		  can only be manipulated gradually management action is
		  needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if
		  drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be
		  delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the
		  indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated,
		  often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve
		  usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that
		  research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather
		  than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical
		  indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem
		  attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio
		  indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is
		  also dependent on developing policy processes that enable
		  society to respond more rapidly to information about
		  impending regime shifts.},

		  Large ecosystem changes such as eutrophication, shifts

		  fluctuating nutrient inputs. Despite the complications of
		  noisy inputs, increasing variability of lake-water
		  phosphorus was discernible prior to the shift to eutrophic
		  conditions. Simulations show that rising standard deviation

  abstract	= {Because novel ecological conditions can cause severe and
		  long-lasting environmental damage with large economic
		  costs, ecologists must identify possible environmental
		  regime shifts and pro-actively guide ecosystem management.
		  As an illustrative example, we applied six potential
		  indicators of impending regime shifts to S. R. Carpenter
		  and W. A. Brock's model of lake eutrophication and analyzed
		  whether or not they afforded adequate advance warning to
		  enable preventative interventions. Our initial analyses
		  suggest that an indicator based on the high-frequency
		  signal in the spectral density of the time-series provides
		  the best advance warning of a regime shift, even when only
		  incomplete information about underlying system drivers and
		  processes is available. In light of this result, we
		  explored two key factors associated with using indicators
		  to prevent regime shifts. The first key factor is the
		  amount of inertia in the system; i.e., how fast the system
		  will react to a change in management, given that a manager
		  can actually control relevant system drivers. If rapid,
		  intensive management is possible, our analyses suggest that
		  an indicator must provide at least 20 years advance warning
		  to reduce the probability of a regime shift to < 5\%. As
		  time to intervention is increased or intensity of
		  intervention is decreased, the necessary amount of advance
		  warning required to avoid a regime shift increases
		  exponentially. The second key factor concerns the amount
		  and type of variability intrinsic to the system, and the
		  impact of this variability on the power of an indicator.
		  Indicators are considered powerful if they detect an
		  impending regime shift with adequate lead time for
		  effective management intervention, but not so far in
		  advance that interventions are too costly or unnecessary.
		  Intrinsic "noise" in the system obscures the "signal"
		  provided by all indicators, and therefore, the power of the
		  indicators declines rapidly with increasing within- and
		  between-year variability in measurable variables or
		  parameters. Our results highlight the key role of human
		  decisions in managing ecosystems and the importance of
		  pro-active application of the precautionary principle to
		  avoid regime shifts.},

  abstract	= {In the Earth's history, periods of relatively stable
		  climate have often been interrupted by sharp transitions to
		  a contrasting state. One explanation for such events of
		  abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system
		  reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains
		  hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even
		  more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a
		  tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future.
		  Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and
		  show that they were all preceded by a characteristic
		  slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the
		  actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased
		  autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a
		  hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply
		  independent empirical evidence for the idea that past
		  abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical
		  thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is
		  fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that
		  our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal
		  early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change.
		  Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex
		  systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this
		  is a promising perspective.},

		  are abrupt, irreversible and among the most catastrophic
		  changes of ecosystems identified. For terrestrial
		  ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation
		  patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent
		  transitions. Here, we analyse how vegetation patchiness
		  changes in arid ecosystems with different grazing
		  pressures, using both field data and a modelling approach.
		  In the modelling approach, we extrapolated our analysis to
		  even higher grazing pressures to investigate the vegetation
		  patchiness when desertification is imminent. In three arid

		  found that the patch-size distribution of the vegetation
		  follows a power law. Using a stochastic cellular automaton
		  model, we show that local positive interactions among
		  plants can explain such power-law distributions.
		  Furthermore, with increasing grazing pressure, the field
		  data revealed consistent deviations from power laws.
		  Increased grazing pressure leads to similar deviations in
		  the model. When grazing was further increased in the model,
		  we found that these deviations always and only occurred
		  close to transition to desert, independent of the type of
		  transition, and regardless of the vegetation cover.
		  Therefore, we propose that patch-size distributions may be
		  a warning signal for the onset of desertification.},

		  Although several different approaches have been proposed

		  from geoscience, an epidemic-spreading model on an adaptive

		  modelling framework to study the archetypal example of a

		  collapse of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC).
		  eScience has been invaluable in this work and we explain
		  how we have made it work for us. Two stable states of the
		  THC have been found to coexist, under the same boundary
		  conditions, in a hierarchy of models. The climate forcing
		  required to collapse the THC and the reversibility or
		  irreversibility of such a collapse depends on uncertain

		  assimilate observational data to constrain the pertinent
		  parameters. Anthropogenic climate forcing leads to a robust
		  weakening of the THC and increases the probability of
		  crossing a THC tipping point, but some ensemble members
		  collapse readily, whereas others are extremely resistant.
		  Hence, we test general methods that have been developed to
		  directly diagnose, from time-series data, the proximity of
		  a 'tipping element', such as the THC to a bifurcation

  abstract	= {The deteriorating health of the world's coral reefs
		  threatens global biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the
		  livelihoods of millions of people living in tropical
		  coastal regions. Reefs in the Caribbean are among the most
		  heavily affected, having experienced mass disease-induced
		  mortality of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum in
		  1983 and two framework-building species of coral. Declining
		  reef health is characterized by increases in macroalgae. A
		  critical question is whether the observed macroalgal bloom
		  on Caribbean reefs is easily reversible. To answer this
		  question, we must resolve whether algal-dominated reefs are
		  an alternative stable state of the ecosystem or simply the
		  readily reversible result of a phase change along a
		  gradient of some environmental or ecological parameter.
		  Here, using a fully parameterized simulation model in
		  combination with a simple analytical model, we show that
		  Caribbean reefs became susceptible to alternative stable
		  states once the urchin mortality event of 1983 confined the
		  majority of grazing to parrotfishes. We reveal dramatic
		  hysteresis in a natural system and define critical
		  thresholds of grazing and coral cover beyond which
		  resilience is lost. Most grazing thresholds lie near the
		  upper level observed for parrotfishes in nature, suggesting
		  that reefs are highly sensitive to parrotfish exploitation.
		  Ecosystem thresholds can be combined with stochastic models
		  of disturbance to identify targets for the restoration of
		  ecosystem processes. We illustrate this principle by
		  estimating the relationship between current reef state
		  (coral cover and grazing) and the probability that the reef
		  will withstand moderate hurricane intensity for two decades
		  without becoming entrained in a shift towards a stable
		  macroalgal-dominated state. Such targets may help reef
		  managers face the challenge of addressing global
		  disturbance at local scales.},

@Article{	  schreiber2008,
  abstract	= {Ecosystems are often indirectly connected through
		  consumers with complex life cycles (CLC), in which
		  different life stages inhabit different ecosystems. Using a
		  structured consumer resource model that accounts for the
		  independent effects of two resources on consumer growth and
		  reproductive rates, we show that such indirect connections
		  between ecosystems can result in alternative stable states
		  characterized by adult-dominated and juvenile-dominated
		  consumer populations. As a consequence, gradual changes in
		  ecosystem productivity or mortality rates of the consumer
		  can lead to dramatic and abrupt regime shifts across
		  different ecosystems, hysteresis and counterintuitive
		  changes in the consumer abundances. Whether these counter
		  intuitive or abrupt responses occur depend on the relative
		  productivity of both habitats and which consumer life-stage
		  inhabits the manipulated ecosystem. These results
		  demonstrate the strong yet complex interactions between
		  ecosystems coupled through consumers with CLC and the need

@Article{	  seekell2011,
  abstract	= {Abstract Regime shifts are massive, often irreversible,
		  rearrangements of nonlinear ecological processes that occur
		  when systems pass critical transition points. Ecological
		  regime shifts sometimes have severe consequences for human
		  well-being, including eutrophication in lakes,
		  desertification, and species extinctions. Theoretical and
		  laboratory evidence suggests that statistical anomalies may
		  be detectable leading indicators of regime shifts in
		  ecological time series, making it possible to foresee and
		  potentially avert incipient regime shifts. Conditional
		  heteroscedasticity is persistent variance characteristic of
		  time series with clustered volatility. Here, we analyze
		  conditional heteroscedasticity as a potential leading
		  indicator of regime shifts in ecological time series. We
		  evaluate conditional heteroscedasticity by using ecological
		  models with and without four types of critical transition.
		  On approaching transition points, all time series contain
		  significant conditional heteroscedasticity. This signal is
		  detected hundreds of time steps in advance of the regime
		  shift. Time series without regime shifts do not have
		  significant conditional heteroscedasticity. Because
		  probability values are easily associated with tests for
		  conditional heteroscedasticity, detection of false
		  positives in time series without regime shifts is
		  minimized. This property reduces the need for a reference
		  system to compare with the perturbed system.},
