  abstract	= {Biologists employ phylogenetic comparative methods to
		  study adaptive evolution. However, none of the popular
		  methods model selection directly.We explain and develop a
		  method based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, first
		  proposed by Hansen. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models incorporate
		  both selection and drift and are thus qualitatively
		  different from, and more general than, pure drift models
		  based on Brownian motion. Most importantly,OU models
		  possess selective optima that formalize the notion of
		  adaptive zone. In this article, we develop the method for
		  one quantitative character, discuss interpretations of its
		  parameters, and provide code implementing the method. Our
		  approach allows us to translate hy- potheses regarding
		  adaptation in different selective regimes into ex- plicit
		  models, to test the models against data using maximum-like-
		  lihood-based model selection techniques, and to infer
		  details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the
		  method using two worked examples. Relative to existing
		  approaches, the direct modeling ap- proach we demonstrate
		  allows one to explore more detailed hy- potheses and to
		  utilize more of the information content of com- parative
		  data sets than existing methods. Moreover, the use of a
		  model selection framework to simultaneously compare a
		  variety of hy- potheses advances our ability to assess
		  alternative evolutionary explanations.},

@Article{	  freckleton2002,
  abstract	= {The question is often raised whether it is statistically
		  necessary to control for phylogenetic associations in
		  comparative studies. To investigate this question, we
		  explore the use of a measure of phylogenetic correlation,
		  lambda, introduced by Pagel (1999), that normally varies
		  between 0 (phylogenetic independence) and 1 (species'
		  traits covary in direct proportion to their shared
		  evolutionary history). Simulations show lambda to be a
		  statistically powerful index for measuring whether data
		  exhibit phylogenetic dependence or not and whether it has
		  low rates of Type I error. Moreover, lambda is robust to
		  incomplete phylogenetic information, which demonstrates
		  that even partial information on phylogeny will improve the
		  accuracy of phylogenetic analyses. To assess whether traits
		  generally show phylogenetic associations, we present a
		  quantitative review of 26 published phylogenetic
		  comparative data sets. The data sets include 103 traits and
		  were chosen from the ecological literature in which debate
		  about the need for phylogenetic correction has been most
		  acute. Eighty-eight percent of data sets contained at least
		  one character that displayed significant phylogenetic
		  dependence, and 60\% of characters overall (pooled across
		  studies) showed significant evidence of phylogenetic
		  association. In 16\% of tests, phylogenetic correlation
		  could be neither supported nor rejected. However, most of
		  these equivocal results were found in small phylogenies and
		  probably reflect a lack of power. We suggest that the
		  parameter lambda be routinely estimated when analyzing
		  comparative data, since it can also be used simultaneously
		  to adjust the phylogenetic correction in a manner that is
		  optimal for the data set, and we present an example of how
		  this may be done.},

		  lambda = 1 means two traits perfectly correlated under
		  brownian motion.
		  
		  is a multiplier of the correlation (off-diagonals)
		  introduced by tree to otherwise independent random walks.
		  hence 0 means that correlation is lost, whereas 1 means all

		  corrleated than expected by tree alone -- i.e. the indep
		  contrasts should also be correlated!
		  
		  Not a measure of phylogenetic signal, which should be

		  electrophoresis. A total of 22 genetic loci was analyzed
		  for 15 populations. These data were used to estimate
		  genetic distance between populations, and genetic variation
		  within populations. Genetic distance estimates between
		  populations are considerably lower than the estimates for
		  the ecologically equivalent Anolis roquet species group of
		  the southern Lesser Antilles. The relative proximity of
		  islands in the northern part of the archipelago increases
		  the probability of multiple colonizations, hence
		  introgression, and a relatively slower rate of genetic
		  divergence. The data also suggest that the northern
		  bimaculatus group is evolutionarily younger than the roquet
		  group, hence has had less time for genetic divergence.
		  There is a geographic pattern discernible in the genetic
		  distance data. One very tight cluster involves the
		  southernmost populations studied from Dominica, Guadeloupe,
		  Marie Gallante, and Montserrat; a second cluster includes
		  more northern forms from Redonda, Saba, and St. Martin.
		  Variability is lowest on the three smallest islands, but
		  beyond that, there is no correlation between island size
		  and heterozygosity. Relative degree of heterozygosity may
		  be related to colonization history. Source populations tend
		  to have higher variability than derived populations. The

		  electrophoretically is very poorly correlated with
		  differentiation for morphological characters such as body
		  size, color, or pattern.},

		  adaptive radiations has proven difficult due to a lack of
		  broad-scale comparative datasets. Here, we use phylogenetic
		  comparative data on body size and shape in a diversity of
		  animal clades to test a key model of adaptive radiation, in
		  which initially rapid morphological evolution is followed
		  by relative stasis. We compared the fit of this model to
		  both single selective peak and random walk models. We found
		  little support for the early-burst model of adaptive
		  radiation, whereas both other models, particularly that of
		  selective peaks, were commonly supported. In addition, we
		  found that the net rate of morphological evolution varied
		  inversely with clade age. The youngest clades appear to
		  evolve most rapidly because long-term change typically does
		  not attain the amount of divergence predicted from rates
		  measured over short time scales. Across our entire
		  analysis, the dominant pattern was one of constraints
		  shaping evolution continually through time rather than
		  rapid evolution followed by stasis. We suggest that the
		  classical model of adaptive radiation, where morphological

		  at the forefront of the biological sciences, and few
		  scientists considered phylogenetic relationships when
		  investigating evolutionary questions. By contrast,
		  systematic biology is now one of the most vigorous
		  disciplines in biology, and the use of phylogenies not only
		  is requisite in macroevolutionary studies but also has been
		  applied to a wide range of topics and fields that no one
		  could possibly have envisioned 30 years ago. My message is
		  simple: phylogenies are fundamental to comparative biology,
		  but they are not the be-all and end-all. Phylogenies are
		  powerful tools for understanding the past, but like any
		  tool, they have their limitations. In addition, phylogenies
		  are much more informative about pattern than they are about
		  process. The best way to fully understand the past-both
		  pattern and process-is to integrate phylogenies with other
		  types of historical data as well as with direct studies of
		  evolutionary process.},

  abstract	= {Aim: Provide a new multivariate hypothesis testing
		  approach for the evolution of continuous characters in a
		  phylogenetic context. Background: Brownian motion is the
		  most commonly used model for the evolution of quantitative
		  traits. Under multivariate Brownian motion, the evolution
		  of multiple continuous traits can be described by an
		  evolutionary rate matrix in which the diagonal elements
		  determine the rate of evolution for individual characters,
		  while the off-diagonal elements determine the extent to
		  which different characters co-evolve. Method: We present
		  likelihood tests for two simple hypotheses about the
		  evolutionary rate matrix: (1) equality or proportionality
		  to a hypothetical matrix; and (2) concerted change in the
		  rate matrix in a certain portion or portions of the
		  phylogenetic tree. In case (1), the hypothetical matrix
		  might be estimated from the within-species additive genetic
		  variance-covariance matrix. In case (2), concerted change
		  in the evolutionary rate matrix might result from shifts in
		  ploidy level or the mutation rate. We illustrate these
		  hypothesis tests using data from individual-based
		  quantitative genetic simulations on stochastic phylogenetic
		  trees. Results: Our evolutionary rate matrix estimator
		  exhibited minimal bias. Type I errors in our
		  likelihood-based tests for matrix equality and
		  proportionality were very close to appropriate levels.
		  Power to detect selection was also sufficient, except in
		  the case of the weakest selection simulated in this study.
		  Type I error and the accuracy of parameter estimation in
		  the test for rate matrix heterogeneity were also
		  adequate.},

		  Haut, Les Saintes, previously described as a subspecies of
		  Anolis marmoratus, are shown to be more closely related to
		  A. oculatus and their elevation to a full species, A.
		  terraealtae, is supported. An island colonisation sequence
		  inferred from the phylogeny shows a general pattern of
